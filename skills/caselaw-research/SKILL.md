# Caselaw research (LawDiver)

Use LawDiver MCP tools only. Never invent case names, citations, holdings, or good-law status.

## When to use

- User asks to find cases on an issue, doctrine, or fact pattern
- User wants jurisdiction-scoped caselaw (state, circuit, SCOTUS, federal, etc.)
- User asks “what cases say about …” or “search caselaw for …”

## Steps

1. If jurisdiction is missing or ambiguous, ask once for the court scope (e.g. California state, Ninth Circuit, all federal). Do not run an unscoped national search.
2. Call `list_jurisdictions` only when the user needs help choosing a jurisdiction code.
3. Call `search_cases` with:
   - `query`: the user’s legal issue in plain language or keywords
   - `jurisdiction`: required object (`type`, plus `state` / `circuit` when needed)
   - `searchType`: `auto` unless the query is clearly a citation or case name
   - `limit`: 5–15 unless the user asks for more
4. Prefer search hit fields (name, citation, court, date, snippet, good-law flags). Do not treat search snippets as the full opinion.
5. If the user needs the full opinion text for a hit, call `retrieve_case` (if needed) then `get_opinion_text` with that `caseId`. Paginate with `nextOffset` until you have enough text.
6. If the user wants to open a hit on screen, call `view_case` with that `caseId` or citation (metadata only; still use `get_opinion_text` before quoting).
7. Answer with cited authorities from tool results only. Flag negative treatment / not-good-law when tools report it.


## Agency decisions

When the question is about an immigration agency decision or guidance rather than a court opinion — BIA or Attorney General precedent, the USCIS Policy Manual, AAO, OCAHO, BALCA, or the Foreign Affairs Manual — and `search_agency_decisions` is listed, call it with `lane` `immigration` or one immigration `agency`. Each hit says whether it is precedential. Use `search_cases` for court opinions, including securities, labor, environmental, patent-board, and trade opinions. If `search_cases` returns `agencyLanes`, follow the hint and call `search_agency_decisions` for that lane. An empty list is not proof the authority does not exist.

## Do not

- Fabricate citations or quote language that did not come from LawDiver tools
- Use LawDiver for restaurants, news, or general web browsing
- Draft or e-file court documents
- Claim you deleted or edited anything in the corpus (tools are read-only)
